Features to add (From easy to difficult)
1. Alternative metrics to compare portfolios, e.g., S.R., drawdown, distribution, etc.
2. Alternative charts to compare portfolios
3. Slider bar to allow users to select a specific time range
4. Allow users to combine existing portfolios (assigning weights) to construct new portfolios
5. FF5 Global_ex_US portfolios are uploaded as well. Add these portfolios to existing strategies. Be mindful because these data are not available until 1990s 
6. Allow users to send feedback, such as which portfolio they like and how much they want to invest. 
6.1. Store such feedback in a database (SQL) for later analysis
7. Allow users to input their current portfolios (e.g., ETF tickers) and allow users to compare their current portfolios with our strategies.
